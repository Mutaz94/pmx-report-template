# RESULTS {#sec-results}

## Exploratory Data Analysis
*Summarize key characteristics of the dataset, including subject counts, time-concentration profiles, covariate distributions, and outliers. Present relevant tables and figures to support findings.*

## Model Development

### Base Model
*Describe the initial structural model(s) tested, including assumptions and selection criteria. Report key parameters (e.g., compartment models, error structures) and highlight major model refinements.*

### Covariate Model
*Summarize covariate selection and analysis steps. Describe relationships between covariates and PK parameters, with forward inclusion/backward elimination results and objective function value (OFV) changes.*

### Final Model
*Present the final parameter estimates with their uncertainty (e.g., standard errors, confidence intervals, CV%). Describe any centering or scaling of covariates used. Provide a comparison between the base and final models.*

## Model Evaluation
*Evaluate model performance using diagnostic plots (e.g., goodness-of-fit, prediction-corrected VPCs). Report shrinkage and other diagnostic metrics. Include stratified results by key covariates if applicable.*

## Model Application

### Covariate Analysis
*Describe the impact of covariates on model predictions and drug exposure. Present simulations or predictions under varying conditions (e.g., alternative dosing regimens, special populations).*
