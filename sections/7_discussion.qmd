# DISCUSSION {#sec-discussion}

*This section provides an interpretation of the modeling results, focusing on their adequacy, clinical relevance, and impact on dosing strategies.*

- **Interpretation and Model Adequacy:**
  *Assess whether the data and model sufficiently support conclusions and recommendations. Discuss the rationale for the modeling approach, including key assumptions and uncertainties.*

- **Comparison with Previous Analyses:**
  *Address consistency or discrepancies with prior population PK analyses, clinical pharmacology studies, or related investigations.*

- **Clinical Relevance:**
  *Evaluate the physiological and clinical significance of identified covariate relationships.*

- **Dosing Strategies and E-R Analysis:**
  *Summarize the evaluation of alternative dosing regimens, with a focus on safety and efficacy outcomes.*
